# Identity Column
Are columns that automatically generates unique integer for each row when you insert a new row to the table.

To define an identity column, you use the `IDENTITY` property:
```SQL
column_name datatype GENERATED { ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT } AS IDENTITY [sequence_option]
```

In this syntax:
- `GENERATED ALWAYS`: Generates sequential integers for the identity column and prevents inserting a value into the column. If you attempt to insert a value into this column, the database will raise an error.
- `GENERATED BY DEFAULT`: Works like `GENERATED ALWAYS` but allows you to insert a value into the column to override the generated value.
- `sequence_option`: Control how the identity generate values.

Here are the options of theÂ `sequence_option`:
- `START WITH`: Defines the starting number of the sequence.
- `INCREMENT BY`: Sets the increment number for the sequence.
- `MINVALUE`: Specifies the minimum number for the sequence.
- `MAXVALUE`: Specifies the maximum number for the sequence.
- `CACHE`: Defines the number of sequence numbers that the database system will cache for performance.
- `NOCACHE`: Turns off caching of sequence numbers.
- `CYCLE`: Restarts the sequence number when it reaches the maximum value.
- `NOCYCLE`: Prevents the sequence from restarting.

In practice, you often use an identity column as the primary key column of a table, where each integer uniquely identifies each row in the table.
