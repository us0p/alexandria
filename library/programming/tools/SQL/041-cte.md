# Common Table Expressions - CTE
Are very simmilar to [subqueries](026-subqueries.md) but can only be used in one query, which can reference the CTE multiple times.

A CTE can't be used in more than one query and the query that uses it must be immediately subsequent to the CTE.

```PostgreSQL
WITH mp AS (SELECT category, MAX(price) AS max_price
			FROM menu_items
			GROUP BY category)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM mp
WHERE max_price < (SELECT AVG(max_price) FROM mp);
```

The query above references the same CTE multiple times.

```PostgreSQL
WITH mp AS (SELECT category, MAX(price) AS max_price
			FROM menu_items
			GROUP BY category),
	 ci AS (SELECT *
			FROM menu_items
			WHERE item_name LIKE '%Chicken%');
SELECT *
FROM ci LEFT JOIN mp ON ci.category = mp.category;
```

This query define multiple CTE which reference multiple tables.

A CTE can also reference a previous CTE in the same statement.
## Recursive queries
Using `RECURSIVE`, a `WITH` query can refer to its own output.

For this reason, CTEs are very useful when you need to do some work again and again. For example with hierarchical or tree-like data structures, such as file systems.

```PostgreSQL
WITH RECURSIVE my_dates(dt) AS (SELECT '1998-10-05' -- achor sections
								UNION ALL -- will stack all the values
								SELECT dt + INTERVAL 1 DAY -- recursive section
								FROM my_dates
								WHERE dt < '1998-10-10')
SELECT * FROM my_dates;
-- 1998-10-05
-- 1998-10-06
-- 1998-10-07
-- 1998-10-08
-- 1998-10-09
-- 1998-10-10
```
## CTE x Temp Tables
If you find yourself using the same CTEs again and again, you can consider to create a [temp table](042-temp_table.md) or store the results of your CTEs into [views](038-views.md).
