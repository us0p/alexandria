# Tab-Completion
PowerShell automatically expands the name to the first match that it finds.

Pressing `Tab` again cycles through all the available choices with each key press.

`PSReadLine` also provides a `MenuComplete` function that's bound to `Ctrl` + `Space`. The `MenuComplete` function displays a list of matching completions below the command line.
