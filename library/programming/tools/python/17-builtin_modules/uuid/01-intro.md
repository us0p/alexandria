# Module: UUID
Provides **immutable** `UUID` objects through the `UUID` class.

If all you want is a unique ID, strick to `uuid1()` or `uuid4()`.

>Note that `uuid1()` may compromise privacy since the created UUID contains the computer's network address.

A safe `UUID` is one which is generated using syncrhonization methods that ensure no two processes can obtain the same `UUID`.

All instances of `UUID` have an `is_sage` attribute which relays any information about the `UUID` safety.
- `safe`: Generated by the platform in a multiprocessing-safe way.
- `unsafe`: Not generated in a multiprocessing-safe way.
- `unknown`: The platform doesn't provide information on whether it was generated safely or not.

## The UUID class
```python
from uuid import UUID, SafeUUID

uuid = UUID(
        hex=None,
        bytes=None,
        bytes_le=None,
        fields=None,
        int=None,
        version=None,
        is_safe = SafeUUID.unknown
    )
```

The constructor above creates an `UUID` from either:
- `hex`: A string of 32 hex digits.
- `bytes`: A string of 16 bytes in big-endiar order.
- `bytes_le`: A string of 16 bytes in little-endian.
- `int`: A single 128-bit integer.
- `fields`: A tuple of six integers 
     (
        32-bit time_low,
        16-bit time_mid,
        16-bit time_hi_version,
        8-bit clock_seq_hi_variant,
        8-bit clock_seq_low,
        48-bit node
    )

**Notes**  
- Exatcly one of the available fields must be given.
- `version` is optional.
- Comparison of `UUID` objects are made by comparing their `UUID.int` attributes.
- Comparison with non-UUID objects raises a `TypeError`.
- `str(uuid)` return a string with 32 hex digits representing the `UUID`

## Functions
The modules defines the following functions.
```python
import uuid

# Get the hardware address as a 48-bit positive integer.
node = uuid.getnode()

# Generate a UUID from a host ID, sequence number, and the current time.
uuid1 = uuid.uuid1()

# Generate a UUID based on the MD5 hash of a namespace and a name
uuid3 = uuid.uuid3(uuid.NAMESPACE_DNS, 'python.org')

# Generate a random UUID
uuid4 = uuid.uuid4()

# Generate a `UUID` based on the SHA-1 hash of a namespace and a name
uuid5 = uuid.uuid5(uuid.NAMESPACE_DNS, 'python.org')
```

## Namespaces identifiers
```python
import uuid

# 'name' string is a fully qualified domain name
dns = uuid.NAMESPACE_DNS

# 'name' strin gis a URL
dns = uuid.NAMESPACE_DNS
```

## CLI
The `uuid` module can be executed as a script from the cli
```bash
python -m uuid [-h] [-u {uuid1, uuid3, uuid4, uuid5}] [-n NAMESPACE] [-N NAME]
```

- `-u` defaults to `uuid4`
