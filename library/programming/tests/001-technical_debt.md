## Technical Debt
Also known as Design Debt or Code Debt, it's the cost of fixing code in the future due to decision made during development. It often happens when teams prioritize speed over quality and is critical to the technical team as it often impacts productivity.

As technical debt grows, the time spent to fix or add new features also increases, making the product hard to maintain, extend, and difficult to predict release schedules leading to missed deadlines and delays which can stress the engineering team resulting in higher staff turnover compounding the problem.

In some cases, taking on technical debt can be a strategic choice to meet immediate goals, such as delivering a proof-of-concept or a quick release.

It's valid to note that even with well managed technical debt, everything becomes a debt eventually, just think about all the old languages like COBOL that worked extremely fine and are now being rewritten into a modern language. This is also a tech debt.

>Something shouldn't be classified as technical debt because it isn't perfect. Perfect, doesn't exist. Over time what was perfect in the past won't be perfect in the future.
## Debt types
- **Unintentional debt:** debt that exists without a planning or previous consideration.
- **Intentional debt:** debt that the team is aware of and was assumed with caution.
## Limitations
- **Product Longevity:** The product must survive long enough for the debt become a burden
## Causes 
- Business pressure.
- Failing to combat coupled components.
- Lack of tests.
- Lack of documentation.
- Lack of distributed knowledge about the product. 
- Delayed refactoring.
- Knowledge and skill gaps.
- Development process issues.
- Lack of best practices.
