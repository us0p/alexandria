# Test Driven Development (TDD)
## Overview
TDD is a software development approach where **test cases are written first** to drive the implementation of the software toward the expected behavior.
It focuses on how the system works from the **inside out** and is a **lower level** of testing. It ensures that you're building the "thing right"
## TDD Workflow
- Tests must be **written before the actual implementation**.
- The implementation must be implemented to fulfill the requirements of the tests.
- After the test is passing, the implementation should be improved through refactoring while the test keep passing.

## Consequences
- Code is written to fulfill test requirements which makes the **design and structure** of the code, more modular.
- Keeps you focused on the purpose of the code.
- Ensures that future code doesn't break your code.
- When tests are written **after** the code, the code often becomes harder to test, leading to **poor design** and **tight coupling** between tests and the system under test (SUT), breaking the principle of **encapsulation**.

TDD is essentially a software development approach in which test cases are developed to **specify and validate** what the code will do.
