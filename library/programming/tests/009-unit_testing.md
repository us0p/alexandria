# Unit Testing  
## Overview  
Unit testing involves testing **individual units of software** to validate that each unit of code performs as expected. It is conducted **during the development phase** by developers.  This is the level where you perform test driven development.
## Purpose  
- Ensures that **each unit of software functions correctly** in isolation.  
- Helps in **verifying the correctness** of a specific section of code.  
- Serves as **project documentation** by providing a reference for how the code is expected to behave.  
## Characteristics  
- A **unit** may be an **individual function, method, procedure, module, or object**.  
- A **unit test should test only one piece of code at a time** to maintain clarity and reliability.
