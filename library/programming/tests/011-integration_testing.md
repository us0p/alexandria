# Integration Testing  
## Overview  
Integration testing involves **logically integrating software modules** and testing them as a **group**. The main objective is to **identify defects** in the interaction between these modules when they are integrated. This is the level where you perform Behavior Driven Development.  
## Purpose
- Ensuring the **interfaces** between modules function correctly.  
- Verifying the **flow of data** between integrated modules.  
## Scope of Integration Testing  
An important aspect of integration testing is determining the **scope**â€”which modules must be integrated to ensure that a **specific feature** works as expected.  
## Characteristics
- use mocks/stubs for external services.
## Example
Checking if the payment gateway correctly processes transactions when integrated with the order system.
