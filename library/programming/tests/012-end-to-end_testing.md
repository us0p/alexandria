# E2E Testing
## Overview
An end-to-end test validates if a specific workflow is working as expected, it uses real services and systems to validate that the workflow is working as expected from the user point of view.
A system testing can have e2e tests, but an e2e test isn't a system testing as the scope is limited to a single workflow.
## Purpose
Ensures that the entire **user journey/workflow** functions as expected in a **real-world scenario**.
## Scope
- Validates entire workflows, including third-party systems.
## Characteristics
- Often involves real systems, databases, and APIs.
## Example
Testing an online shopping process from login -> adding to cart -> payment -> order confirmation.
