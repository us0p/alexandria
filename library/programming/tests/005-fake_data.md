## Factories and fakes
Factories and fakes are used to create fake data and fake instances of objects so that you can use as realistic tests data on your tests, often you want to do this when you need to create many different data and don't want to do this manually.
For JavaScript you can use [Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/).
