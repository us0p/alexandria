# Test Isolation
## Importance of Test Isolation
Tests should always be run independently from one another while still passing reliably. When tests are not isolated, they may depend on the results or state of other tests, leading to false positives and making it harder to debug. Additionally, having tests confidently run in any order enables parallelization within CI/CD, which vastly improves test execution time. This is especially time-consuming for large or complex systems.
## Benefits of Test Isolation
- Ensures that every unit works well without outside impacts.
- When a specific application unit is tested in isolation, there are fewer variables to consider, making it easier to determine the cause of a bug. This can save time and effort in debugging.
- Isolated testing allows optimization of a unitâ€™s efficiency without worrying about interactions with other code.
- Helps simulate different load conditions and stress testing on specific components to ensure they can handle their designated tasks efficiently.
## Methods of Test Isolation
### Utilizing Test Doubles
Test isolation utilizes test doubles to simulate the behavior of external dependencies. This involves isolating the unit under test from external dependencies, such as:
- Databases
- Web services
- Network connections
- External libraries

Mock objects or stubs are commonly used to achieve this isolation.
### Test Isolation in End-to-End Testing
In end-to-end testing, test isolation involves executing tests for individual user journeys or specific functionalities within a complete application workflow. By isolating these tests, testers can independently validate the behavior of specific features, user interactions, or scenarios.
## Strategies for Test Isolation
There are two different strategies when it comes to test isolation:
1. **Start from Scratch**  
   - Everything is new for each test execution.  
   - If a test fails, debugging is straightforward since the issue is contained within that test.  
2. **Cleanup in Between**  
   - Requires cleaning up after each test.  
   - Can be easy to forget cleanup, leading to test state leaks.  
   - Some elements may be impossible to clean up, making debugging more difficult.

Starting from scratch is generally preferred, as it ensures complete isolation and eliminates dependencies on prior test executions.
