# Firewall
It's a security system, either hardware, software, or both, that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of security rules.

Protects your computer, server, or network by:
- Blocking unauthorized access
- Allowing legitimate communication
- Preventing cyberattacks like malware, ransomware, or intrusion attempts
## How it works
A firewall sits between a **trusted internal network** (like your private home or corporate network) and an **untrusted external network** (like the internet).

It inspects packets, and based on rules (e.g. "block port 23"), it **allows or denies** the traffic.
## Use cases
- Blocking suspicious IP addresses
- Restricting access to certain websites or services
- Segmenting internal network zone
- Protecting cloud infrastructure
