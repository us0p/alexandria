# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
Critical practice in modern software development that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.

It ensures faster, more reliable, and efficient software delivery by streamlining workflows and reducing manual intervention.

CI/CD helps developers integrate code changes frequently into a shared repository, where automated tools build, test, and validate the code. This process minimizes integration issues, catches bugs early, and ensures that the software is always in a deployable state.

[GitHub Actions](github_actions_overview.md) is a CI/CD platform commonly used to automate your build, test, and deployment pipelines.
