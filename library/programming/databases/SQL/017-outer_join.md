# OUTER JOIN
Are joins that return matched values and unmatched values from either or both tables.
- [LEFT JOIN](018-left_join.md): Returns matched rows in both tables as well as **unmatched rows from the left table**.
- [RIGHT JOIN](019-right_join.md): Returns matched rows in both tables as well as **unmatched rows from the right table**.
- [FULL OUTER JOIN](021-full_outer_join.md): Returns all rows from both tables, **matched and unmatched**.

Note that:
- `LEFT JOIN` = `OUTER LEFT JOIN`
- `RIGHT JOIN` = `OUTER RIGHT JOIN`
- `FULL OUTER JOIN` = `OUTER JOIN`
