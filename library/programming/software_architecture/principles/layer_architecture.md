# Layered Architecture
Architecture in which functionality of a system is divided into a set of layers, with each layer having a specific responsibility and interacting with the layers above and below it.

The main idea behind a layered architecture is to separate the concerns of the system into distinct and independent layers, making the code more modular, easier to understand, test, and modify.

There are several types of layered architectures, but a common one is the three-layer architecture which consists of:
- Presentation Layer
- Business Layer
- Data Access Layer
