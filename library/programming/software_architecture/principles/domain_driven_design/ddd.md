# Domain Driven Design
Is an approach to software development that aims to match the mental model of the problem domain we're addressing.
## Goals
- Discover the domain model by interacting with domain experts and agreeing upon a common set of terms to refer to **processes, actors and any other phenomenon that occurs in the domain**.
- Embed those terms into the code to create a rich model that reflects the actual business and its rules.
- Protect the model from all the other technical intricacies.

Enables you to write expressive, rich and encapsulated software that are testable, scalable and maintainable.
