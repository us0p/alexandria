# Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - FDIC
Is an independent agency of the U.S. government created to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation's financial system. It provides deposit insurance to protect depositors' funds in the event of a bank failure, covering deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank. Established in 1933 during the Great Depression, the FDIC has ensured that no depositor has lost insured funds since its inception. For more detailed information, you can visit the official FDIC website.
# Exchange-Traded Fund - ETF
Is a type of investment fund that holds a collection of securities, such as stocks and bonds, and is traded on stock exchanges like a regular stock. ETFs are designed to track or outperform an underlying index, providing investors with a diversified portfolio at a lower cost compared to traditional mutual funds. They typically have low ongoing expenses because they are often passively managed.
## Equity
Equity represents the amount of money that would be returned to a company's shareholders if that company were to liquefy its assets, pay off its debts, and distribute the remainder of its capital.

More generally, equity can be thought of as a degree of ownership of an asset after subtracting all debts associated with it. Equity is recorded on a company's balance sheet along with assets and liabilities.

To determine a company's equity, just take the sum of their assets and subtract the sum of their liabilities.
