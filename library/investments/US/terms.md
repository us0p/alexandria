# Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - FDIC
Is an independent agency of the U.S. government created to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation's financial system. It provides deposit insurance to protect depositors' funds in the event of a bank failure, covering deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank. Established in 1933 during the Great Depression, the FDIC has ensured that no depositor has lost insured funds since its inception.
