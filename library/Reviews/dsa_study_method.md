- Use C to force fundamentals.
- Don't waste too much time on the same algorithm, do one for each variation of the algorithm or 5 to 10 exercises and go to the next, keep a rotative routine on the basics. E.g. Two pointers can be used to find pairs or to partition arrays, doing 5 to 10 exercises on each of those variations should be good enough.
- Should always determine what the problem is about, the most difficult exercises are all about interpretation rather than implementation.
