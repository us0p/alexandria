## Don't justify new knowledge when not asked
You don't need to justify or explain that you never had a professional 
experience with some concept or tech.
I know it's scary to assume understanding of something that you don't feel  comfortable, but that behavior isn't going to take you anywhere in the interview.
If a question is asked and you don't know the answer, take a note, that's 
something that you must learn or dive deeper.
