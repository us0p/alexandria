your resume should be easily readable by an AI agent.
your resume should be a history of your achievements.

the resume, as the name says, is only a resume to know if you have then minimum fit with the opportunity, if you have all the requirements they are looking for.
You should focus in displaying that you have the required technical, minimum and bonus requirements.
A quality is measured for each opportunity and is based on the amount of keywords that mach with the given opportunity
Remember the recruiter isn't going to understand technical details.

Should avoid big paragraphs, with technical details. Split it in bullet points where each point represents an achievement that you have accomplished in the company.

The interview is the process to understand if you have the fit with the company values and mission.

Note about projects
You should demonstrate the impact of your projects, or, what you have accomplished with your projects. If you have many projects in your portfolio, with many techs, you might be seen as the "eternal student", the one that knows a little about anything but doesn't know anything deeply.
You should comprove your experience with a project that others can access and measure that in numbers.

Your resume should be personalized for the current position your are applying. you need to tailor your previous experiences to highlight the points that matches with the requirements of the opportunity.

The resume is the place to demonstrate that you have experience with the requirements of the opportunity, you don't need to dive into details, as those details are going to be spoken during the interview.

When looking at a new position, you should clearly understand what the opportunity really wants.
- how much years of experience
- daily activities for the position
- minimum requirements
- bonuses requirements
- company industry (what the company does)

You should always hook the matches of your resume with the opportunity with keywords.

In the opportunity you should highlight the more important points for the position and add those keywords in strategic points in your resume.

Soft skill should be left out of the resume if they aren't mandatory for your position, you should talk about them during the interview
- age isn't required
- nacionality isn't required
- city isn't required (it's good only if you're in the same city as the company)
- basically don't use anything that can be used against you
