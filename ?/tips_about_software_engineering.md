# Tips from software engineering (from 10 years of experience)
## Clean code is overrated
What really matters:
1. Code that runs
2. Code that scales
3. Code that another dev understands in 2 minutes

You can spend months writing perfect code that will be deleted in weeks.
## Technical debt is feature
Every company has technical debt, including big techs. You need to choose which one you're going to take.
## Your first design is wrong
Every first design is an hypothesis.

Don't waste time trying to do it perfectly, instead:
1. Simple MVP
2. Test with real users
3. Iterate fast
## Logs > Tests
Tests doesn't:
1. Catches production logs.
2. Show real behavior.
3. Help debugging.
## Saying "no" is a tech skill
Saying "no" to:
1. useless features
2. complex code
3. meetings without subject

Is going to save you a tons of time, but, you need to know how to say it.
## The best code, is the one that's not written
Every line of code is:
- A potential bug
- More maintenance
- More complexity

Less code = less problems
