# Key interview questions and how to answer them
## "Tell me about a difficult project you worked on"
The recruiter wants to know how you handle real challenges

The perfect structure for the answer has four elements:
- The project context and why it was complex
- The specific challenges you faced along the way
- The decisions you took to solve each problem
- The mensurable results that you achieved
## "Why are you looking for new opportunities?"

Try to demonstrate how you're looking for growth opportunities aligned with your carer.

Try to connect with the company that's interviewing you.

>Never speak badly of your current job
## "How do you handle conflicts in your team?"
Recruiters are tired of hearing generic responses about communication and sympathy.

Use a real example of when you mediated a conflict and transformed it and a positive result.
## "What's your biggest achievement?"
You need to tell an story that demonstrate three things:
1. A real challenge that you faced
2. How your solution impacted the business
3. Numbers that demonstrate the real result
## "Why do you want to work here?"
Everyone answers something generic about the company being awesome.

Do you research before:
- Read their last blog post
- Understand the problem they are trying to resolve
- Connect it with your experience
