# Study Plan DSA
Solve problems in categories, focus on mastering one category at a time. This helps you recognize patterns and apply the right approach instinctively.

Start with core data structures they usually are the building blocks for advanced techniques:
	- arrays
	- linked lists
	- stacks
	- hash maps
Once you get good at basics, repeat them until it's second nature. Practice key techniques like binary search, DFS, BFS, and two-pointers methods multiple times, using different problems and variations.

>Every algorithm works on top of a determined data structure or groups of data structures that provides a specific benefit. Learning the data structure of a specific algorithm first will make it easier to understand, why it works originally.

- 30 minutes every day.
- Every Friday, review challenging exercises and solve them from scratch.
- Practice **6 easy** problems per category to solidify learning. Then practice **9 medium** and **3 hard** problems to make it second nature.
## Tips
- Always describe the time complexity of your code.
- Don't spend several hours trying to solve a problem you're stuck on. Look at the solution if you're not making progress after 15 - 20 minutes. If you can't understand the solution under 45 to 60 minutes, try an easier problem.
- If you can solve most medium problems that you haven't seen before, within 20 to 25 minutes, you can probably pass most interviews.
- Always bring up edge cases proactively. Common ones are: null values, empty arrays, duplicates, negative numbers, off-by-one issues.
- Don't blindly memorize algorithms without understanding why they work.
