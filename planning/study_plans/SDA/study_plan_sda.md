## 1. Build a Strong Conceptual Foundation
Before you can _practice_, you need to know _what_ to look for.
## Follow [Software Design and Architecture Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/software-design-architecture)
Also, learn about the following extra topics
- **Domain Driven Design**: learn it right
- **Clean Architecture**: Review and learn how does it complement DDD
- **Architectural patterns**: layered, hexagonal
- **Quality attributes (non-functionals)**: scalability, reliability, maintainability, security, performance.
## How to put it to practice
- **Practice Through Small, Real Projects**: should take it only 2 to 3 days to build it all.
- **Study and Reconstruct Existing Systems**: Following the constraint above, doing so would help you understand project designs and build up a portfolio.
- **Post your designs on Reddit**: `r/softwarearchitecture`
- **Write architecture case studies**: Good opportunity to create a blog and demonstrate expertise.
### Tools to use:
- [C4 Diagrams](https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=C4+Diagrams&mid=2664FF69CAF1E6B293282664FF69CAF1E6B29328&FORM=VIRE): visualize components and data flow.
- [Architecture decision record (ADR)](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record): document your reasoning.
- [Structure101](https://structure101.com/), [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/), or simple dependency graphs to inspect module relationships.
## Measuring Architectural Success
Effective architectures can be evaluated across multiple dimensions:
### Technical Metrics
- System performance under load
- Time required to implement new features
- Number and severity of production incidents
- Code complexity and maintainability metrics
- Technical debt accumulation rate
### Business Metrics
- Time-to-market for new features
- Total cost of ownership
- Customer satisfaction and retention
- Business agility and ability to pivot
- Competitive advantage gained through technology
