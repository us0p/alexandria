## Rust project ideas
- Convert strings to pig latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to the end of the word and _ay_ is added, so _first_ becomes _irst-fay_. Words that start with a vowel have _hay_ added to the end instead (_apple_ becomes _apple-hay_). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!
- Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company; for example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.
