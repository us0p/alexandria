## Pomodoro timers
- **3h:** 45m/w + 10m/sr + 25m/lr -> 75% work rate
- **1h:** 50m/w + 10m/lr -> 83% work rate
- **2h:** 30m/w + 5m/r + 20m/lr -> 75% work rate

1. DSA (practice every day)
2. System Design (get an overall knowledge, then start creating designs)
3. Backend General Knowledge (fundamental base knowledge, get an overall knowledge, deepen as needed)
	- Internet
	- Learn about APIs
	- Web Security
4. Software Architecture (More advanced knowledge, get an overall knowledge specially to know when and where to apply it, study implementation as needed)
	- Architectural Styles
	- Architectural Patterns
5. Software Design (More advanced knowledge, get an overall knowledge specially to know when and where to apply it, study implementation as needed)
	- Design Patterns
	- Development Principles
6. Technologies (low level knowledge, hard to reuse as it depends on each team, get an overall knowledge, study as needed)
	- Terraform
	- GitHub Actions
	- AWS
		- Fargate
		- CloudWatch
		- Event Bridge

You want to be really good in:
1. DSA
2. Software Design and Architecture

Once you get a good overall understanding of all of this topics, if you work in a small single project every weekend, you'll be able to work points 2 to 5 together as needed and deepen your knowledge in the areas you need the most at that time.
