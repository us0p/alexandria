# Makefiles are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to be recompiled;
# Make can also be used beyond compilation too, when you need a series of instructions
# to run depending on what files have changed.
# The goal of Makefiles is to compile whatever files need to be compiled, based on what
# files have changed.
