# Alexandria
During my journey as a software engineer i've learned a lot of tools 
of a variety of different domains. However, as the time goes by, as a 
human, i forgot how to use some of those tools.

This repo is a collection of all the things i've learned during my journey
structured in a way that i can revisit any time to remember the 
functionality or details of specific tools.

With time, i hope, that it becomes a big library filled with hundreds of 
details of hundreds of tools so that any developer can find details and 
implementation guides to avoid "starting over" every time it need to work 
with something unnusual.

With time, we might be able to create or own *Library of Alexandria*!
